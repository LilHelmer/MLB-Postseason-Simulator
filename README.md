# MLB-Postseason-Simulator
 
## Introduction
This project simulates 2016 Major Baseball League postseason using Monte Carlo algorithm and calculate winning probability for each of the 8 participants. The goal is to find out whether we can use statistics from regular season to infer the outcome of postseason, in the other words, the team with the most wins in regular season has the highest probability to win the world series title?   
The methodologies and assumptions of this project are based off [Rudelius, Thomas](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/bpjjqsprt/v_3a8_3ay_3a2012_3ai_3a1_3an_3a10.htm)'s research published on *Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports (2012)*
